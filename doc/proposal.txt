Hi, Professor. I'd like to share my idea for my final project and get your feedback.
In my project, a robot is placed in a grid-based maze. There are some machine parts and obstacles.
The robot moves only in straight lines until hitting an obstacles;
It cannot go back on its own path;
The goal is to collect all scattered machine parts in one continuous motion and reach the exit.
